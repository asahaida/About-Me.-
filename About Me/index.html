<p>Hello! Thank you for viewing my page and your interest in me. I am an artist who is both a visual and hands-on learner. Back in grade school, during library time, while my peers read Campbell’s Soup for the Soul books, I read and practiced with the learn how-to-draw books. My first art sale was actually my grade-school art teacher.  My love for the arts carried into highschool, where upon graduation, I won the sole Artist Award. For my undergraduate degree, I studied Studio Art at Webster University, in which I won the Cecil Hunt Memorial Award at my B.A. show.  As an adult, I continued with my art - doing freelance work, such as commissioned drawings and paintings and then eventually event photography.  While wrapping up my MA degree for Leadership & Organizational Development at Saint Louis University (in which I won a Distinguished student award for my 4.0 GPA and final research project), I was also working on a 6-month UX Design Certification through the University  of Denver, Colorado.  Thus, my skills have evolved from drawing to painting to photography to research, to UX. </p>
<p>Foursight Thinking Profile/Ideator</p>
<h2>Ideator</h2>
<p> Ideators think big.</p>
<p>Ideators love to play with ideas, explore perspectives and invent alternatives. They are dreamers for whom the world is full of possibilities. Ideators are global thinkers, comfortable making guesses, offering hypotheses, using intuition, seeing connections, and simply making things up. They feel innovation with novelty, originality and aesthetic flare. Ideators are energetic, spontaneous, playful, curious, social, flexible, and adventurous. They are quick to challenge the status quo and don't mind standing out from the crowd. They are open to change, attracted to novelty and adaptable in new situations. Ideators  tend to have a wide set of interests.They like variety, autonomy, independence and improvisation, and they feel stifled in situations that are too structured, rule-bound or routine. Ideators' curiosity and love of variety can make them prone to distraction, and their gift of global thinking can cause them to overlook details. When communicating, ideators should know that their ideas might sound random, strange, even alarming to others; they should be prepared to color in their abstract ideas with more concrete details, facts and plans. Ideators should never let naysayers crush their creative spirit. Once they successfully harness their imaginations, they have the power to change the world.</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>

<p>Over the past 15 years, I have worked for various enterprises and a diverse range of leaders such as Scientists, Neurologists, Government officials, Educators, and Artists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>• By September 17th, 2024, I will have completed a boot camp intensive—apprenticeship-like UX/UI Design certification through the University of Denver, Colorado. </li>
  <li>• By August 11th, 2024 - I will have completed my MA in Leadership & Organizational Development from Saint Louis University.</li>
  <li>• In 2008, I obtained my B.A. in Studio Arts (with a minor in education) from Webster University. I still actively create art as a freelance artist who owns her own business. </li>
</ul>

<p>As a self-motivated individual, I excel in autonomous and flexible environments and thrive in playful and relaxed atmospheres. I also enjoy a healthy mix of both team and independent work. I would love to work with a diverse cohort of individuals from various creative backgrounds—that way, we could all learn from one another every day. In this way, I aspire to be a lifelong learner who is highly interested in collaborating with an executive coach as a guide at my next place of work; as well as completing my own certification toward coaching - as teamwork is the present and future.   I have enjoyed working in various disciplinary fields - if your organization has a healthy culture, the context does not really matter to me. However, I am particularly interested in the creative Industries (e.g., art, entertainment, TV/film, recreation, literature), S.T.E.A.M, higher education, nature, and animals. I also generally admire organizations that promote social corporate responsibility, regenerative development, and holistic professional development for all members.  Finally, I appreciate a culture that fosters psychological safety, supports action learning/experiential learning, coaching/mentoring, adult transitions, development, emotional intelligence, cultural competency, LGBTQ+, equity, diversity, & inclusion, neurodiversity, and women and other minorities in leadership roles.</p>
